About the Founder (for public domains, media kits, speaking profiles)
🌟 Long-Form Founder’s Bio (Updated)
Obed Udoete Linus is a visionary entrepreneur at the forefront of Africa’s green transformation. As Founder of Ecovest Technologies, he leads a mission to fuse technology, sustainable finance, and environmental innovation into solutions that regenerate ecosystems while creating wealth.
Obed’s journey is rooted in a strong foundation of academia, policy, technology, and international environmental diplomacy. A former lecturer, he cultivated a passion for knowledge transfer and capacity building. His tenure at the Federal Ministry of Environment deepened his expertise in environmental policy and practice, where he worked closely with the current Director of the Department of Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought Management — the office charged with restoring degraded lands in Nigeria and supporting other African landscapes. His role as Executive Assistant to Former UNCCD Nigeria Desk Officer further gave him first-hand experience in advancing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification’s mission of land restoration and sustainable development.
Complementing this is Obed’s strong background in technology and digital innovation. As a Digital Product Designer and Manager, and an experienced Web Designer and Developer, he has led the creation of platforms that merge environmental data with user-friendly interfaces, turning complex sustainability challenges into accessible, market-ready solutions. His ability to bridge tech design with environmental strategy sets Ecovest apart as a company that is as digitally agile as it is mission-driven.
With this unique blend of teaching, government service, global policy, and technology leadership, Obed brings rare insight into both the technical and strategic dimensions of Africa’s environmental challenges. Today, his work spans from building digital platforms for carbon credit trading and satellite monitoring to forging strategic partnerships with governments, NGOs, and global investors.
In just a few years, Obed and his team have positioned Ecovest Technologies as a catalyst for land restoration, carbon neutrality projects, and climate-smart investments. His driving belief is simple yet disruptive: profit and restoration are not opposites — they are partners.
In the next five years, Obed envisions Ecovest at the center of Africa’s sustainability economy, generating millions in profits while creating a healthier, more livable continent. Looking ahead a decade, his goal is global: to make Ecovest a leading partner in restoration-driven prosperity worldwide.
